        acts or omissions by you in connection with your account. Gigs on MicroJob may be offered at a base starting
        price of $5. Some Gigs are offered at a base price of more than $5 as determined by the Seller. Buyers pay
        MicroJob in advance to create an order (see Payment Terms). Orders are purchased through the Order button found
        on a Seller’s Gig page or through a Custom Offer. For fees and payments please read the Payment Terms Sellers
        must fulfill their orders, and may not cancel orders on a regular basis or without cause. Cancelling orders will
        affect Sellers’ reputation and status. Sellers gain account statuses (Levels) based on their performance and
        reputation. Advanced levels provide their owners with benefits, including offering services for higher prices
        through Gig Extras, or selling their Gig in multiples. Users may not offer or accept payments using any method
        other than placing an order through MicroJob.com. When purchasing a Gig, Buyers are granted all rights for the
        delivered work, unless otherwise specified by the Seller on their Gig page. Note: some Gigs charge additional
        payments (through Gig Extras) for Commercial Use License. See our “Ownership” and “Commercial Use License”
        sections below for more information. Fiverr retains the right to use all published delivered works and Logo
        Designs for Fiverr marketing and promotion purposes. We care about your privacy. You can read our Privacy Policy
        here. Users undertake to comply with MicroJob’s Community Standards, which are a set of behavior rules and
        guidelines, applicable to the Fiverr community and marketplace in addition to these Terms of Service, as updated
        from time to time. MicroJob offers its users the Logo Maker, which allows certain Sellers to offer various
        original logo designs for Buyers to adjust and customize per their own specific needs, using special automated
        design tools. Through the Logo Maker, Buyers purchase full commercial use rights to the Logo Design embedded
        with their brand name. SELLERS Basics Sellers create Gigs on Fiverr to allow Buyers to purchase their services.
        Sellers may also offer Custom Offers to Buyers in addition to their Gigs. Each Gig you sell and successfully
        complete, accredits your account with a revenue equal to 80% of the purchase amount. MicroJob accredits Sellers
        once an order is completed. See our "Orders" section below for a definition of a completed order. For more
        information about receiving payments, fees and taxes see the Payment Terms. Sellers may not promote their Gigs
        or any MicroJob content via the Google Ads platform. The Seller's rating is calculated based on the order
        reviews posted by Buyers or Business Account Team Members. High ratings allow Sellers to obtain advanced Seller
        levels (see Levels below). In certain cases, exceedingly low ratings may lead to the suspension of the Seller’s
        account. For security concerns, MicroJob may temporarily disable a Seller’s ability to withdraw revenue to
        prevent fraudulent or illicit activity. This may come as a result of security issues, improper behavior reported
        by other users, or associating multiple MicroJob accounts to a single withdrawal provider. Sellers are
        responsible for obtaining a general liability insurance policy with coverage amounts that are sufficient to
        cover all risks associated with the performance of their services.
